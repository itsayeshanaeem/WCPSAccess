Welcome to WCPS-python-project's documentation!
==================================

These problems can be greatly reduced by designing an Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL). The EDSL design pattern aims to map the syntax of the embedded language (here the WCPS language) into the syntax of a host language (here Python). This allows for automatically reusing the abstraction capabilities and tooling of the host language.
